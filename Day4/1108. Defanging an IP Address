QUESTION: 1108. Defanging an IP Address
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.
A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

CODE:
class Solution {
    public String defangIPaddr(String address) {
        return address.replaceAll("[.]","[.]");
    }
}

-----ORRR-------
The above solution is not very optimal plus slightly confusing the other method we can do uses the concept off StringBuilder and looping.





CODE:
class Solution {
    public String defangIPaddr(String address) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        for(char c: address.toCharArray()){
            if(c=='.'){
                sb.append("[.]");
            }
            else{
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
