QUESTION: 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.


CODE:

THIS IS  ONE OF THE SOLUTION , BUT IS NOT OPTIMAL COZ IN QUESTION WE ARE ASKED O(n) TIME COMPLEXITY, WHILE Arrays.Sort() ITSELF IS O(nlogn). THE OTHER BETTER SOLUTION IS ALSO MENTIONED NEXT TO THIS CODE


class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int count=0;
        int max=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(i==nums.length-1){
                max=Math.max(count,max);
            }
            
            if(i!=nums.length-1 && nums[i]+1==nums[i+1]){
                count++;
               
            }
            else{
                if(i!=nums.length-1 && nums[i]==nums[i+1]) continue;
                else{
                max=Math.max(count,max);
                count=0;}
            }
            
        }
     return max+1;   
    }
}
