QUESTION: 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget
You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer maxCost.

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.

If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6
s and t only contain lower case English letters.





CODE:

class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int left=0;
        int sum=0;
        int len=0;
        int n=s.length();
        for(int right=0;right<n;right++){
            
            sum+=Math.abs((s.charAt(right)-'a')-(t.charAt(right)-'a'));
            
            if(sum<=maxCost){
                len=Math.max(right-left+1,len);
            }
            else{
                sum-=Math.abs((s.charAt(left)-'a')-(t.charAt(left)-'a'));
                 left++;
            }
            
        }
        return len;
    }
}
