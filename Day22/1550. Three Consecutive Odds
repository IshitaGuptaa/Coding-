QUESTION: 1550. Three Consecutive Odds
Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.
 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000







CODE:


class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int left=0;
        int n=arr.length;
        int odd=0;
        for(int right=0;right<n;right++){
                       
            odd^=(arr[right]&1);
            
            if(right-left+1==3){
                if(odd==1 &&(odd^(arr[right-1]&1))==0){
                return true;}
                odd^=(arr[left]&1);
                left++;
            }
            
            
            
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
