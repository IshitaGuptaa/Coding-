QUESTION:  1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K
Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Note:

1 <= K <= 10^5






CODE:
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;
        int module = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= K; ++i) {
            module = (10 * module + 1) % K;
            if (module == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
