QUESTION: 796. Rotate String
We are given two strings, A and B.

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
Note:

A and B will have length at most 100.



CODE:
class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String A, String B) {
        if(B.length()!=A.length()) return false;
        A=A+A;
        if(A.indexOf(B)!=-1){return true;}
        return false;
    }
}
