QUESTION:344. Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.


CODE:

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        
        int left=0;
        int right=s.length-1;
        
        while(left<right){
            char temp=s[right];
            s[right]=s[left];
            s[left]=temp;
            
            right--;
            left++;
        }
        
        
    }
}
