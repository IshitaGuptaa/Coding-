QUESTION: 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0



CODE:

class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
         
        for (int i=0;i<nums.length-1;i++){
            if(nums[i+1]<nums[i])
                return nums[i+1];
        }
        
        return nums[0];
    }
}
