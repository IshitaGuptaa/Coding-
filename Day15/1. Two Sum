QUESTION:1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].





CODE:

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    
        
        int n=nums.length;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
                    return new int[]{i,j};
                }
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{0,0};
    }
}
