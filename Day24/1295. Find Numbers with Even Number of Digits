QUESTION: 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5







CODE:
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i:nums){
            if(String.valueOf(i).length()%2==0){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

INNOVATIVE IDEA-


CODE:
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        int digits = (int)Math.log10(nums[i]);
        if(digits%2!=0){
            count++;
        }
    }
        return count;
    }
}

//The log with base 10  of any number n return the number of 10s needed to get multiplied to get the n.
	//	For eg: the log base 10 of 100 gives you 2.
		//i.e two 10s needed means it should be three digit value, three 10s needed means it should be 4 digit value, and so on.
