QUESTION:1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.






CODE:

class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int count=1;       
        while(count<arr[arr.length-1]){
            if((Arrays.binarySearch(arr,count)<0)){
                k--;
                if(k==0){
                return count;
            }}
            count++;
        }
        return count+k;
    }
}
