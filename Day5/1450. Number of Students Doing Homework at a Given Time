QUESTION:1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time
Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.
The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].
Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.


CODE:

class Solution {
    public int busyStudent(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int queryTime) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<startTime.length;i++){
            if(endTime[i]>=queryTime&& startTime[i]<=queryTime){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
