QUESTION: 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.
  
  
  CODE:
  
  class Solution {
    public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
        
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            nums[i]+=nums[i-1];
        }
        return nums;
    }
}

//How it is optimal, 1st of all we are not using any sum variable and since we are not using it we can optimise our by also starting the pointer from 1 and not 0.
