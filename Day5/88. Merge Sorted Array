QUESTION:88. Merge Sorted Array
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
Note:
The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
Example:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]


CODE:

class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        
        while(n>0){
            nums1[m+n-1]=nums2[n-1];
            n--;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
    }
}
