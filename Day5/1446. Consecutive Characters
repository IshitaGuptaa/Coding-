Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.
Return the power of the string.

CODE:

class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        int max=0;
        int count=1;
        int len=s.length();
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            if(i+1!=len && s.charAt(i+1)==s.charAt(i)){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                max=Math.max(max,count);
                count=1;
