QUESTION: 1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary
Given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the employee i.
Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

Example 1:
Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000)/2= 2500

Example 2:
Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
Output: 2000.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000)/1= 2000

Example 3:
Input: salary = [6000,5000,4000,3000,2000,1000]
Output: 3500.00000

Example 4:
Input: salary = [8000,9000,2000,3000,6000,1000]
Output: 4750.00000

CODE:

class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        int sum=0;
        Arrays.sort(salary);
        for(int i: salary){
            sum+=i;
        }
        return (double)(sum-salary[0]-salary[salary.length-1])/(salary.length-2);
    }
}

---OR---

similar solution , with no such submission percentages difference-

CODE:
class Solution {
	public double average(int[] salary) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < salary.length; i++) {
            sum += salary[i];
            if (max < salary[i]) {
                max = salary[i];
            }
            if (min > salary[i]) {
                min = salary[i];
            }
        }
        return ((double) sum - max - min) / (salary.length - 2);
    }
}


// Rather than sorting the entire array, we can simply calculate min, max and substarct in the end. Better solution
