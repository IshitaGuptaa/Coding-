QUESTION: 455. Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.



CODE:
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        
        int pointer_a=0;
        int pointer_b=0;
        int count=0;
       
        while(pointer_a<g.length && pointer_b<s.length){
            if(g[pointer_a]<=s[pointer_b]){
                count++;
                
                 pointer_a++;
                 pointer_b++;
            }
            else{
                pointer_b++;
                 
            }
             
        }
        return count;
    }
}
